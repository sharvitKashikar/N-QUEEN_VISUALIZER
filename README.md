# N-QUEEN VISUALIZER

This project provides a visualizer for the classic N-Queen problem, demonstrating the recursive backtracking algorithm's step-by-step execution.

## How it Works

The `N-queen.py` file contains the `solveNQUtil` function, which implements the recursive backtracking algorithm to find solutions for the N-Queen problem. It iterates through possible queen placements, checks for safety, and recursively calls itself to place subsequent queens. When a queen is placed or removed, the visualizer updates the grid to show the state of the board.
